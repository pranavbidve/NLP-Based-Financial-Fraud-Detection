This project investigates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect financial fraud in transaction descriptions and loan application text. The goal is to identify deceptive or high-risk patterns embedded in unstructured financial narratives that traditional rule-based systems often miss.

The project covers end-to-end data preprocessing, text representation, and supervised machine learning models, with a focus on real-world applicability in banking, lending, and risk analytics.
